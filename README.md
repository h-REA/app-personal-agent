Collaborate together in a value network.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

nd. Agent consumes data from 2 possible endpoints, both used in the faircoop ecosystem. If you want to install Agent locally and you're not part of faircoop, [you need to install also the backend locally](https://github.com/FreedomCoop/valuenetwork/blob/master/docs/install.txt)

### Prerequisites

You need `nodejs` and `npm` installed on your machine.

### Run Shroom on your machine locally

Shroom is an ejected version of CRA - Create react app - project.
In order to have a local version of Shroom running on your machine you will need to follow these steps:

```
git clone git@github.com:ivanminutillo/shroom.git
cd shroom
npm install
npm start
```

## Running the tests

The test suite is made with [Puppeeter](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/puppeteer) and [Jest](https://github.com/facebook/jest). Currently the app is covered only with End to End tests. We will cover the app also with unit tests.

To run the tests:

```
npm run debug
```

## Deployment

Agent is a static app, therefore deployment is quite straightforward. You mainly need to build your app.

```
npm run build
```
The resultant artifact contains the static files that will interact with the graphQl layer, you can deploy the folder with github-pages, zeit or any (serverless, or classic) hosting service.

The fair.coop Agent version is deployed with [Zeit](zeti.co) <3
